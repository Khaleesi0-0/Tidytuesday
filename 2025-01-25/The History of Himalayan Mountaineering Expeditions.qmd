## The History of Himalayan Mountaineering Expeditions


```{r}
exped <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/exped_tidy.csv')
peaks <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/peaks_tidy.csv')

```



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)


# join two dataset
exped <- exped |>
  mutate(PEAKID = as.character(PEAKID))

peaks <- peaks |>
  mutate(PEAKID = as.character(PEAKID))

exped_joined <- exped |>
  left_join(peaks, by = "PEAKID")
exped_joined <- exped_joined |>
  mutate(overall_success = SUCCESS1 | SUCCESS2 | SUCCESS3 | SUCCESS4)

```
## Visualization 1: Expedition Duration vs. Peak Height
```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(exped_joined, aes(x = HEIGHTM, y = TOTDAYS, color = REGION_FACTOR)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Expedition Duration vs. Peak Height",
    subtitle = "Exploratory Analysis (no claims of causation)",
    x = "Peak Height (meters)",
    y = "Total Expedition Days",
    color = "Region"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

print(plot1)
```
## Visualization 2: Expedition Counts by Overall Success
```{r}
success_summary <- exped_joined |>
  group_by(overall_success) |>
  summarise(count = n()) |>
  ungroup()

plot2 <- ggplot(success_summary, aes(x = factor(overall_success), y = count, fill = factor(overall_success))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Expeditions by Overall Success",
    subtitle = "Success defined as at least one successful route",
    x = "Overall Success (FALSE = No, TRUE = Yes)",
    y = "Number of Expeditions",
    fill = "Overall Success"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("FALSE" = "tomato", "TRUE" = "seagreen")) +
  theme_minimal()

print(plot2)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
